# Goertzel Algorithm for the TMS320C66x

Implementation of the Goertzel algorithm in C to detect multiple frequencies on the TMS320C66x microprocessor.

## Aims

Our aim with this project was to implement the Goertzel algorithm in C to detect multiple frequencies on the TMS320C66x microprocessor.  
This includes understanding microprocessor clock functions and interrupts.  
Undertand how to use the eclipse programming environment.  

## Technologies

C in eclipse to code for microprocessors.

## Report

Included in the repository is the write up we did for the project. This is done in the style of a IEEE conference paper and contains the theory behind the algoithm and our results.
